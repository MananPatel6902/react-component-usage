## react-component-usage

A tool for UI or Design System teams to scan codebases for occurrences of their React components that match a set of pre-defined rules. The tool is triggered automatically after `npm install` is run on a project that contains npm modules you have authored that have a dependency on `@react-component-usage/postinstall`
